loop-youtube-video
============

A [simple and lightweight userscript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/104084) that adds a Loop button to YouTube that lets you auto-repeat videos. Useful for those who don't need (or want) more complicated, bloaty features. Tested on Firefox 19 and Chrome 26, with both the Flash and HTML5 players.
