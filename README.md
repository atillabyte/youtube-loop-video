youtube-loop-video
============

A simple and lightweight userscript that adds a Loop button to YouTube that lets you auto-repeat videos. Useful for those who don't need (or want) more complicated, bloaty features. Tested on Firefox 19 and Chrome 26, with both the Flash and HTML5 players.

Install from [openuserjs.org](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/bitsofpancake/Loop_YouTube_Video) or [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/104084).
